## DevOps Course lessons outcomes:

**Module 1: Introduction to Agile and DevOps**

- Lesson 1: Waterfall vs. Agile

    Understanding and learning that Agile and waterfall are two distinctive methodologies of processes to complete projects, the difference between them, how Agile is an iterative/incremental methodology that incorporates a cyclic and collaborative process, and Waterfall is a sequential methodology.

    Also, understanding the different challenges that will be faced during applying the waterfall approach, and how Agile/DevOps overcomes these challenges.

- Lesson 2: What is required to be a DevOps Engineer?

   Understanding and learning what are the different jobs/roles across the SDLC and DevOps Disciplines, the different practices/principles across these disciplines, and how Being T-Shaped skills as DevOps span across disciplines and technologies.

    Also, understanding the difference between being T-Shaped and I-Shaped and how Knowledge and Skills levels change for each form.

- Lesson 3: Understanding Lead Time and Frequency of Deployment 

    Understanding the difference between Lead time and  Cycle time, what it means for frequency of deployment, how they are important to measure the progress of the project, and how improving them is very important for achieving high performance and continuous delivery.

    Also, understanding how DevOps covers The End-to-End Engineering, and one of its goals is enhancing lead time and increasing the frequency of deployment.

**Module 2: Application Development Lifecycle in Action**

- Lesson 1: Introduction to Requirements Engineering and Backlog

    Understanding and learning the difference between classic and modern requirements engineering processes and tools, how to capture the requirements in classic software engineering using SRS (Software Requirements Specification), and how to capture the requirements in modern software engineering using Azure DevOps Product Backlog.

- Lesson 2: Introduction to Virtual Machine (VM)

   Understanding and learning what is Virtual Machine (VM), what is the difference between the VM and the Container, when the VMs are an ideal choice, and what are the advantages of it.

   Also, understand how to enable virtualization, create and examine Windows 11 VM from the gallery, what is the checkpoint, and how to create, apply, and delete it.

   Also, understand and practise how to create Ubuntu 20.04 and 18.04 VM from the gallery on the cloud using Ubuntu 20.04 and 18.04 images, and how to create an empty VM, create all configurations to it and install Windows 10 from the ISO file.

- Lesson 3: Developing an Application with Several Options

    Understanding the structure of the applications, how to organize and structure your app logically (for humans) and physically (for machines), and what is the difference between DLL and the Exe.

    Also, apply and implement the following demos (**Note:** it is very important to practise and implement these demos).
    - Create a Console App with business logic inside.
    - Create a Desktop App with business logic inside.
    - Create an API App with business logic inside.
    - Create a Class library and move the business logic inside it.
    - Amend the Console App to use the class library.
    - Amend the API App to use the class library.
    - Amend the Console App to use the API.	 
    - Amend the Desktop App to use the API.
    - Create another API App that will use the 1st API.

- Lesson 4: Understanding Types of Applications and Their Workflow

    Understanding what are the different types of applications, what are the types of architecture models and workflow for these different applications.

    What are the components/elements of the App development, what is the difference between Library and API, and and when we need the dependency libraries (DLLs).

    Also, understand the concept of packaging and its process, why it is important, why we do it, what is the concept of package management, and what is the NuGet package management and explore it well.

    Also, apply and implement the following demos.
    - Package and deploy API app to IIS.
    - Package the class library and publish it to the NuGet package
    - Replace the class library in the API with the NuGet package library.

- Lesson 5: Code Quality Verification in Action

    Understanding the different types of verification, what is the difference between static and dynamic analysis, how to write a unit test for your app, and what are the different quality metrics.

    Also, understand what is cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index metric, depth of inheritance metric, class Coupling metric, lines of Source code metric, and code coverage and how can we use them to measure the quality of code.

    Also, apply and implement the following demos.
    - Create a Unit test for the class library.
    - Explain and examine code coverage, and code metrics.
    - Examine a UI test and run it.
