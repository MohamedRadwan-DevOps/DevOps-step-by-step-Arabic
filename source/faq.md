## Are there any rules for writing our questions/issues?
Yes, we have well-defined guidelines, please review them very well by watching the explanation in the session video by [clicking here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3sPXx4Hzmw), also you can review them in this closed issue ( [issue #2 )](https://github.com/MohamedRadwan-DevOps/devops-step-by-step/issues/2) 

## I have an issue in the chat area during the session and I can't send messages?
I didn't disable the chat for anyone, most people have no issue, try to reconnect, if it's still not working, there is no option to do it from our side.


## How to join the meeting?
If you register, you will get an email invite which has the meeting link.


## Do I need to install Microsoft Teams?
No, it's even better if you don't, you can use the browser only or mobile and join as a guest which means you don't even need a Microsoft account to join, find more info here:<br>

## I have an issue joining the meeting using MS Teams?
Most people join the meeting without any issue following the instructions provided in the email, if you have any issue, it could be regarding your machine configuration or due to the meeting reaching out the maximum numbers (250).

## I want to contribute but I don't know what should I do?
You need to learn what it means to be a contributor and I am trying to help everyone here.
To start contributing to this project or any other projects. There are only 3 ways to do thatâ€¦..

1. If you don't like anything in the project, you see an improvement or you have a suggestion, just fork and do it in your fork (repo) then raise a PR (Pull Request).
2. If you donâ€™t want to do that, just raise an issue/enhancement/bug, etc. on GitHub issues.
3. You can also try to solve open issues, vote for issues or discussions, comment, or discuss to improve the content, etc.


## What if I raised or opened an issue and it is deleted without any comment?
If itâ€™s deleted without any comments, it means you failed to provide the minimum of a good question or it's out of the scope, try to read the good question guidelines again and review the FAQ page very well.


## What if I raised a Pull Request (PR) and it is not accepted?
If itâ€™s not accepted without any comments, it means you failed to provide any value compared to the time needed to provide feedback for you, therefore always do a PR which has small changes and learn how to provide small values first. Just think if you can provide a value, no one will reject that value even if itâ€™s very small but if your PR has many changes and the feedback will take a long time to explain and report to you than to do the task itself, probably you will not receive a feedback.
E.g. if you correct a spelling mistake in a few words or fix broken links and raise a PR, no one will reject that ðŸ˜Š

So, again, always do a small PR and learn from the feedback from your mistakes.


## What is needed to contribute to the community?
You need to learn the culture of the community, some of that as the following:
- Honest and transparent
- Contributor vs. Consumer
- Initiative and Proactive vs. Reactive 
- Actions vs. suggestions
- Deep reading and adhering to details
- Do your homework first before asking for help or more info
- No repeated questions  
- Willing to help before seeking recognition
- Quality of contribution  
- Welling and looking for feedback even if itâ€™s too tough 
- Community only opens the door, you have to walk through it


## Can I ask any questions regarding any subject outside the session topic?

No, you are only allowed to ask related questions to the discussed topics.
Most of the questions will be at the end of the session, but you can ask a few questions during the session.
