# Contribution Culture

## Culture and guides for our contributors

1. Don't raise a pull request (PR) that is not related to any issues or product backlog item (PBI).

1. Your pull request must have only changes that related to the related issue or PBI

1. You can't assign an item to yourself directly, you should have the approval first.

1. If you want to work on any item you can ask for approval first, once gets approved and assigned you can start working.

1. You can't work on more than one item at the same time (work sequential, not parral)

1. Once your item is in the review status you can pick another one.

2. Check the size of the PBI first, if it is large you can divide it into small items if it is possible.
