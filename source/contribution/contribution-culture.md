# Contribution Culture

## Culture and guides for our contributors

1. Don't raise a pull request (PR) that is not related to any issues or product backlog item (PBI).

1. Your pull request must have only changes (commits) that related to the related issue or PBI.

1. You can't assign an item to yourself directly, you should have the approval first.

1. If you want to work on any PBIs, you can ask for approval first, once you get the approved and assigned, you can start working.

1. You can't work on more than one PBIs at the same time (work sequential, not parallel) (WBS is one per contributor)

1. Once your item is in the review status you can pick another one.

1. Check the size of the PBI first, if it is large you can divide it into small items if it is possible.

1. Don't move item from new to Ready until it has size and priority.

1. Use comments in PBIs and Issues to discuss any topics and avoid using chat except urgent cases.
