# Cancellation and Return Policy

Please be aware that only before the halfway point of the course(before Session No. 5), can a refund be claimed. In this instance, the refund will be given less the cost of any sessions that were attended or that had already ended before the refund. In addition to the transfer cost, the application fee will also be subtracted from the administrative fee.
Please be aware that any participant's enrollment in the course may be terminated at any time for failure to comply with [Terms & Conditions](/source/terms-conditions.md "Terms & Conditions") of the program. In this instance, the payment will be refunded in the same manner as the return request.
